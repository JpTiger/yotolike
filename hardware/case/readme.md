# Music Box Case (Onshape Design)

This folder has the stls from the case I designed in OnShape, but you may want to modify and export them yourself - I've got my daughter's name on mine for example, and it's likely your micro-usb to usb c adapter will have slightly different dimensions since the one I used seems to have disappeared. I'd suggest editing the part studio for the UPS HAT, which has the adapter built into it. You'll need calipers.

## Exports
If you want to just try the version I used, STL files for 3D printing are included in the [`exports/`](exports/) folder:
- Case - card and reader stand.stl
- Case - Container.stl
- Case - Lid.stl
- Case - switch shield.stl
- Case - ups switch nub.stl
