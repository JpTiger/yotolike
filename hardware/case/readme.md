# Music Box Case (Onshape Design)

This folder has the stls from the case I designed in OnShape, but you may want to modify and export them yourself - I've got my daughter's name on mine for example, and it's likely your micro-usb to usb c adapter will have slightly different dimensions since the one I used seems to have disappeared. I'd suggest editing the part studio for the UPS HAT, which has the adapter built into it. You'll need calipers.

## Exports
If you want to just try the version I used, STL files for 3D printing are included in the [`exports/`](exports/) folder:
- Case - card and reader stand.stl
- Case - Container.stl
- Case - Lid.stl
- Case - switch shield.stl
- Case - ups switch nub.stl

I suggest assembling the case by:
1. printing all parts 
2. inserting the speakers into the main container
3. attaching the RFID reader to the card and reader stand
4. instering the card and reader stand into the T-shaped slot that matches the bottom of it
5. putting the little switch shield on the switch of the UPS
6. instering the pi and hat stack (without the USB C adapter) into the space for them in the container
7. insterting the USB C adapter in from the hole of the container into the microusb slot
8. using poster putty or(if you're confident and dexterous) hot glue or to attach the clear PETG filament to the LEDs on the pi and UPS on one end and to the holes in the container on the other. I interted a long strand through the holes, poked it with poster putty on a toothpick until it stuck direclty onto the LEDs, then trimmed the other end of the filament at the hole end.
9. Installing the rotary encoder, tightenting, and then the same with the momentary button
10. adding the ups switch nub to the switch from the outside
11. adding the lid

If your rotraty encoder didn't come with a knob, you may need to print that as well. [This one worked for me.](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2549137)
